For any trading pair ABC/XYZ, ABC is called the **base currency**, and XYZ is called the **quoted currency**.

A trader who is **buying ABC/XYZ** is buying the base currency, and selling the quoted currency. ie A buyer of ABC/XYZ is buying ABC, selling XYZ.

Similarly, a trader who is **selling ABC/XYZ** is selling the base currency, and buying the quoted currency. ie A seller of ABC/XYZ is selling ABC, buying XYZ.

The size of an order/trade is always in terms of the base currency. An order of 100 for ABC/XYZ refers to 100 units of ABC.

Example: A trader buys 100 ABC/XYZ at $20. This means the trader receives 100 ABC, and pays 2000 XYZ.

Example: A trader sells 50 ABC/XYZ at $30. This means the trader receives 1500 XYZ, and pays 50 ABC.
